- **RAM:** Minimum 4 GB
- **Storage:** Approximately 300 MB + database files
- **Display Resolution:** 1280Ã—800 or higher
- **Supported Databases:** PostgreSQL, MariaDB, MySQL, Derby (Embedded & Client)

## Recommended Configuration

- Java 17 or newer (64-bit)
- 8 GB RAM or more

## Supported Databases

The following database systems and drivers should be compatible out of the box:

| Database                     | Status                  | Notes                                        |
|------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Apache Derby - Embedded Mode  | ðŸ§ªFallback/Test  | If no valid database configuration is found, the software will use an embedded Derby database as a fallback for file persistence (typically for testing). |
| Apache Derby - Client Mode    | ðŸ§ªDeveloper        |                                              |
| PostgreSQL                    | âœ…Compatible       |                                              |
| MySQL                         | âœ…Compatible       |                                              |
| MariaDB                       | âœ…Compatible       |                                              |

## Configuration

This application uses a database for data storage.  
The database configuration is located in the `config.properties` file, which should be stored alongside the executable JAR.

Example configuration for PostgreSQL:

```properties
# PostgreSQL Database Configuration  
db.type=postgresql  
db.driver=org.postgresql.Driver  
db.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydatabase  
db.user=postgres  
db.password=secret  
db.schema=update
